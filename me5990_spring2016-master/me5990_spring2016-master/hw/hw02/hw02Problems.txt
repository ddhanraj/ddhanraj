Homework 02
Due: 8:05 AM, Feb. 4, 2016

Complete the following problems:

0) Read in the LabVIEW help file (access via the LabVIEW Help Menu) the following sections:

a) Fundamentals -> Loops and other Structures
b) Fundamentals -> Graphs and Charts

Select the "Contents" tab on the left to view the sections of the help file.

After reading these sections, complete the problem01 - problem14 in this folder. Each problem
has a problem pdf or text file. Those created by NI will typically walk you through
the exercise. Those created by me are less guided. Save the VI or VIs in the folder specified.
Some problems have a bonus challenge written by me.

Note that a number of the NI instructions say that you will find the "needed" VIs in the 
"Exercise" subfolder. If you find that there are no VIs in the subfolder, or that the
subfolder doesn't exist, it is because there are actually no needed VIs. You must created
them all.
