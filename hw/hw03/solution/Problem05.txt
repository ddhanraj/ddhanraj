i) According to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorm, Billy needs 
2*22.5 kHz = 45 kHz sampling speed.

ii) Billy could implement an analog low-pass or notch filter prior to his DAQ.
Alternatively, Billy could acquire at the sampling speed above (or
higher) and implement a digital filter to remove the noise from his data.
Alternatively, Billy could average numerous samples to reduce the noise.

iii) Assuming the Billy implemented an analog filter, he needs to sample at
at at least 200 Hz.

iv) Using f_a = |n*f_s - f_0|, and choosing either n=22 or n=23 to minimize f_a,
the alias will appear at 500 Hz.
