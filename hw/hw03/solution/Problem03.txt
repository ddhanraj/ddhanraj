i) Sensor A is an rotary encoder. Counter-timers are the best DAQ type for encoders.

ii) Sensor B is a rotary potentiometer. When properly powered, it has an analog voltage output.
Alternatively, a device which can directly measure resistance could be used. In either case,
analog input is the best DAQ type.

iii) In both cases, a power sources is needed.

iv) The encoder only has 128 lines per revolution, or a resolution of 360/128 = 2.8 deg.
Therefore, it would be better to use the rotary pot for small angle measurements.

v) The rotary pot has a limited number of turns (1). Therefore, it is not suitable
to measure multiple revolutions of anything.
