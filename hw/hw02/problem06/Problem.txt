Then create a VI which will calculate the first 30 elements in the recursive sequence

y_i = y_(i-1) - 3*y_(i-2) + y_(i-3)

You will need to specify i_0, i_1, and i_2. Create one or more controls
to allow for these values to be specified. This VI will be similar to the
VI "ShiftRegisters.vi" discussed on the "Shift Registers" slide (#46)
of LabVIEWBasics1.pptx

Save the VI as RecursiveSequence.vi
