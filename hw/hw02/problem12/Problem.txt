Complete the VI FunctionGraph.vi by implementing code to create the proper
graph when the update button is pressed. (Add code where it says "Place your
code here.) Note that the indicator "Function XY Graph" is an XY Graph indicator.

Bonus Challenge: Replace Function XY Graph with a Waveform Graph indicator. Modify
your code to achieve the same functionality as before. Save the modified VI as
"FunctionWaveformGraph.vi"
