Complete the following problems:

1) In this folder, you will find a file named Problem1.txt. 
  
  a) Using a text editor, edit the file by putting your name at the bottom.
    (Notepad, installed with Windows will work. I recommend installing
    Notepad++ to get a full featured text editor. 
    https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
  
  b) Run git status to see that the file has been editted
  
  c) Follow the class Git Instructions document to commit this change to
     your local repository.
     
  d) Run git status again to make sure that the change has been committed.
  
2) Using LabVIEW, create a new VI in this folder. Do the following:
   
   a) Place at least two numeric controls and one indicator on the front
      panel.
      
   b) Perform some operation in the block diagram (this could be as simple
      as adding the two numbers and outputing the result, but it's up
      to you).
      
   c) Save the VI as "Solution2.vi"
      
   d) Add the file to your local repository with git add
   
   e) Commit the changes
   
3) Edit this file to write the answers to the following questions. After
   editting the file, be sure to commit the changes.
   
   a) What is the smallest integer datatype that can represent the 
      following numbers. Note if signed or unsigned will work
      
      145:
      -356:
      100000:
      -3000000000:
      3000000000:
      
    b) You are measuring the displacement (distance) of a cylinder in and
       engine. The total uncertainty of your measurement is 1%. All other
       things being equal, what is the best choice of datatype to store
       an individual measurement?
       
       i) single-precision float
       ii) double-precision float
       iii) unsigned 32-bit integer
       iv) string
       
    c) Suppose you have an signed 12-bit integer. What are the minimum
       and maximum values that could be encoded by this type?

4) Edit your github profile and include a professional picture.
